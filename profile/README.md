# The Aurora Terminal Project

Welcome to **The Aurora Terminal Project**! üåå‚ú®

Aurora is an **open-source** terminal application built in Rust, aiming to
provide a sleek customizable, and powerful terminal experience with a focus
on interactivity, split panes, and compatibility with traditional shell
environments like Bash and Zsh.

## Project Vision

The Aurora Terminal is designed to bring vibrancy, flexibility, and enhanced
usability to the command line. Inspired by the elegance and color the aurora
borealis, our goal is to make terminal usage not only efficient but also
visually pleasing and enjoyable. And because it's **open-source**, everyone can
contribute, learn, and share!

## Key Features

- **Customizable Themes**: Personalize your terminal's look and feel with
  custom color schemes and transparency settings.

- **Split Panes & Multiple Views**: Work across different terminal panes
  simultaneously, allowing seamless multitasking.

- **IDE-like Editing & Navigation**: Use mouse support, rich cursor control,
  and IDE-inspired features to navigate your terminal effectively.

- **True Color & Transparency Support**: Enjoy rich visuals with 24-bit color
  support and a transparent background for a modern, aesthetic terminal
  experience.

- **Compatibility with Common Shells**: Use Bash, Zsh, Fish without losing
  any functionality or performance.

- **Command History Search and Aliases**: Quickly search your command history
  and create aliases to boost productivity.

## Project Goals

The Aurora Terminal Project aims to build an extensible and modular terminal
environment where users can:

- **Customize the experience** to suit their workflow and preferences.

- **Seamlessly connect to remote servers** using ssh.

- **Benefit from powerful productivity features** like command auto-completion,
  history search, command correction, and command suggestions.

- **Extend functionality** through a plugin system (future goal), allowing the
  community to build upon and enhance the terminal's capabilities.
